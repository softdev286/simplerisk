','Developers and system integrators are required to perform a static code analysis of custom code prior to release to production or customers, in order to identify any potential coding vulnerability. ','Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for security reviews. Such analysis can be used to identify security vulnerabilities and enforce security coding practices. Static code analysis is most effective when used early in the development process, when each code change can be automatically scanned for potential weaknesses. Static analysis can provide clear remediation guidance along with defects to enable developers to fix such defects. Evidence of correct implementation of static analysis can include, for example, aggregate defect density for critical defect types, evidence that defects were inspected by developers or security professionals, and evidence that defects were fixed. An excessively high density of ignored findings (commonly referred to as ignored or false positives) indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or tool.

Dynamic code analysis employs run-time tools to help to ensure that security functionality performs in the manner in which it was designed.

Fuzz testing strategies derive from the intended use of applications and the functional and design specifications for the applications. To understand the scope of dynamic code analysis and hence the assurance provided, organizations may also consider conducting code coverage analysis (checking the degree to which the code has been tested using metrics such as percent of subroutines tested or percent of program statements called during execution of the test suite) and/or concordance analysis (checking for words that are out of place in software code such as non-English language words or derogatory terms).','Technical','Enhanced','SA-11(8) ','','','','SA-11(8) ','','','','','','','','','18.4','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','X','','X','X','','','','X','X','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','X','','',''),(28,'Technology Development & Acquisition','TDA-13','Use of Live Data ','The organization approves, documents, and controls the use of live data in development and test environments for the information system, system component, or information system service.
